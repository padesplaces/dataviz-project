## Setup
There are several directories in this repository:

- `data/` containing precomputed networks using our data exploration
- `data_analysis/` containing jupyter notebooks used for our data exploration and generation of data files
- `doc/` containing a backup of our documentation (for every submission)
- `src/` containing code of our visualization (with subfolders for css, js and images files)
- `visualizations_alternatives/` other visualizations we explored to display our data
